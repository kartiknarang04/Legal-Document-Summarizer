Gupte, P. C. Bhartari and J. B. Dadachanji, for the appellants (in C.A. No. 386 of 1966) and the respondents (in C.A. No. 387 of 1966).\\nI. N. Shroff and Rama Gupta, for the State of Madhya Pradesh.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami, J.\\nThese appeals are brought by special leave from the judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated 16th April, 1963 in ' First Appeal No. 217 of 1959, whereby the High Court modified partly the judgment of the first Additional District Judge, Jabalpur dismissing Civil Suit No. 10 A of 1954.\\nThe suit was instituted against the State of Madhya Pradesh by Beohar Raghubir Singh and his three grand sons.\\nBeohar Raghubir Singh 's son, Beohar Rajendra Sinha, was a pro forma defendant.\\nA notice under section 80 of Civil Procedure Code had been given by Raghubir Singh on 11th January, 1954.\\nPlaintiffs 2, 3 and 4, his grand sons were joined as plaintiffs because in a partition made subsequent to the giving of the notice, they were each entitled to 1/5th share along with the first plaintiff.\\nBeohar, Rajendra Sinha was joined as a defendant because he did not choose to join as the plaintiff.\\nThe plaintiffs sought a declaration (1) that the three nazul plots in suit had been in possession of the plaintiffs and the predecessors in their own right from time immemorial and their status was that of Raiyat Sarkar; and (2) that the order of the State Government in the Survey and Settlement Department refusing to recognise their possession over the plots was wrong and ultra vires.\\nThe dispute relates to Phoota Tal a tank situated within the town of Jabalpur.\\nIt was plot No. 282 in the settlement of 1863 A.D.\\nIts area then was 957 5.24 acres.\\nit was recorded as malkiat Sarkar and in the last column there was an entry showing possession of Aman Singh Thakur Prasad.\\nThe next settlement took place in 1890 91.\\nThe survey number of Phoota Tal was changed to plot No. 325.\\nIts area remained the same, it was recorded as \\\"water (pani)\\\" and in the last column, the entry showed the possession of Beohar Narpatsingh Raghubir Singh.\\n, The third settlement took placed in 1909 10.\\nThe plot number of Phoota Tal was then , it was still recorded change to 327.\\nIts area remained the same it was still recorded as 'water\\\", but there was no entry in favour of any one showing possession.\\nThe nazul settlement took place in 1922 23.\\nIn this settlement, the tank was given numbers 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and 171.\\nIts area was recorded as 5.24 acres.\\nIn this settlement about 2 acres of land was found to be occupied by the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur.\\nThe land so found to be occupied was recorded in the possession of the Muncipal Committee, Jabalpur and the remaining land was again recorded as \\\"Milkiat Sarkar\\\".\\nThere was no entry regarding possession in the remarks column so far as the remaining land was concerned.\\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Thakur Prasad and Aman Singh were their ancestors, that they had been in continuous possession of the disputed landand the omission to record their possession in the last two settle ments of 1909 10 and 1922 23 was due to some oversight.\\nIn 1948 the first plaintiff made an application for correction to the Deputy Commissioner, Jabalpur who made an order in his favour exhibit P 5.\\nThe order of the Deputy Commissioner was however set aside by the State Government on 28th May, 1953 and it was held that the plaintiffs had no title to the disputed land.\\nThe plaintiff therefore prayed for a declaration of the title to the disputed plots and for the correction of the entry in the settlement record showing the status of the plaintiff as that of \\\"Raiyat Sarkar\\\".\\nThe suit was contested by the State of Madhya Pradesh.\\nIt was urged that the plaintiff had no possession over the disputed land and the order of the State Government dated 28th May, 1953 was correct.\\nIt was contended that plaintiffs 2, 3 and 4 had no right to institute the suit because no notice under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code was given on their behalf.\\nThe suit was not contested by the second defendant Beohar Rajendra Sinha.\\nBy its judgment dated 24th January, 1959 the trial court held that there was no documentary evidence from 1891 to 1932 to support the possession of the ancestors of the plaintiffs regarding Phoota Tal.\\nThe trial court also held that in all the settlement entries, the land was recorded as belonging to the Government \\\"Milkiat Sarkar\\\".\\nIn any event, between 1891 to 1932 there was no evidence regarding the user of the property by the plaintiffs and in the subsequent years a part of the property was found in possession of the Municipal Committee.\\nThe trial court dismissed the suit.\\nAgainst the judgment of the trial court 958 the plaintiffs preferred an appeal to the High Court.\\nThe High Court held in the first place the notice exhibit P 8 was not in conformity with section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code.\\nThe High Court held that Beohar Raghubir Singh had lost the right to represent the joint family as karta at the time of institution of the suit because there had been a severence of joint status and the notice served by Beohar Raghubir Singh could not ensure to, the benefit of the other plaintiffs.\\nOn the merits of the case, the High Court found that the plaintiffs had established their possession for the statutory period of 60 years.\\nThe High Court held that the plaintiffs had acquired the right of Raiyat Sarkar and that the order of the State Government refusing to correct the revenue record was illegal.\\nOn these findings the High Court modified the judgment of the trial court to the extent that there was a declaration in favour of the plaintiffs that they were entitled to 1/5th share of the property in dispute and the claim regarding the 4/5th share was dismissed The order of the State Government dated 28th May, 1953 refusing to recognise the possession of the plaintiffs was held to be wrong and illegal.\\nThe first question to be considered in these appeals is whether the High Court was right in holding that the notice given under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code by the first plaintiff was effective only with regard to Raghubir Singh and.\\nthe notice was ineffective with regard to the other plaintiffs and therefore Raghubir Singh alone was entitled to a declaration as regards the 1/5th share of the dispute plot.\\nOn behalf of defendant No. 1 it was contended by Mr. Shroff that at the time of giving notice the plaintiffs and the second defendant were joint and plaintiff No. 1 Raghubir Singh was karta of the joint family.\\nThe notice was given on 11th January, 1954 and the suit was instituted on 20th July, 1954.\\nIt was admitted that between these two dates there was a disruption of the joint family of which Raghubir Singh was a karta.\\nIt was argued that the right of the first plaintiff to represent the family had come to an end before the institution of the suit, and hence plaintiffs 2, 3 and 4 had to comply individually with the provisions of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code before appearing as plaintiffs in the suit, In our opinion, there is no justification for this argument.\\n, We consider that there is substantial identity between the person giving the notice and the persons filing the suit in the present case.\\nAt the time of giving notice the first plaintiff Beohar Raghubir Singh was admittedly the eldest member of the joint family and being a karta he was entitled to represent the joint family in all its affairs.\\nThe cause of action had accrued at the time of giving of the notice and it was not necessary to give a second notice merely because there was a severence of the joint family, before 20th July, 1954 when the suit was actually instituted.\\nIt is obvious 959 that the notice was given by Beohar Raghubir Singh as a representative of the joint family and in view of the subsequent partition the suit had to be instituted by, all the divided members of the joint family.\\nWe are of the opinion that the notice given by Beohar Raghubir Singh on 11th January, 1954 was sufficient in law to sustain a suit brought by all the divided coparceners who must be deemed to be as much the authors of the notice as the karta who was the actual signatory of the notice.\\nThere is substantial identity between the person giving the notice and the persons bringing the suit in the present case and the argument of defendant No. 1 on this point must be rejected.\\nThe object of the notice under section 80, Civil Procedure Code is to give to the Government or the public servant concerned an opportunity to reconsider its or his legal position and if that course is justified to make amends or settle the claim out of court.\\nThe section is no doubt imperative; failure to serve notice complying with the requirements of the statute will entail dismissal of the suit.\\nBut the notice must be reasonably construed.\\nAny unimportant error or defect cannot be permitted to be treated as an excuse for defeating a just claim.\\nIn considering whether the provisions of the statute are complied with, the Court must take into account the following matters in each case (1) whether the name, description and residence of the plaintiff are given so as to enable the authorities to identify the person serving the notice; (2) whether the cause of action and the relief which the plaintiff claims are set out with sufficient particularity; (3) whether a notice in writing has been delivered to or left at the office of the appropriate authority mentioned in the section; and (4) whether the suit is instituted after the expiration of two months next after notice has been served, and the plaint contains a statement that such a notice has been so delivered or left.\\nIn construing the notice the Court cannot ignore the object of the legislature, viz., to give to the Government or the public servant concerned an opportunity to reconsider its or his legal position.\\nIf on a reasonable reading of the notice the plaintiff is shown to have given the information which the statute requires him to give, any incidental defects or irregularities should be ignored.\\nIn the present case, the notice was served on 11th January, 1954 by Beohar Raghubir Singh.\\nThe notice stated the cause of action arising in favour of the joint family.\\nThe requirements as to cause of action, the name, description and residence of the plaintiff were complied with and the reliefs which the plaintiff claimed were duly set out in the notice.\\nIt is true that Beohar Raghubir Singh did not expressly describe himself as the karta.\\nBut reading the contents of the notice exhibit P 8 in a reasonable manner it appears to us that the claim of Beohar Raghubir Singh 960 was made on behalf of the joint family.\\nIt is true that the term of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code must be strictly complied but that does not mean that the terms of the notice should be scrutinised in an artificial or pedantic manner.\\nIn Dhian Singh Sobha , Singh & Anr.\\nvs The Union of India & Anr.\\n(1) Bhagwati, J. observed in the course of his judgment : \\\"We are constrained to observe that the approach of the High Court to this question was not well founded.\\nThe Privy Council no doubt laid down in Bhagchand Dagadusa vs Secretary of State (2) that the terms of this section should be strictly complied with.\\nThat does not however mean that the terms of the notice should be scrutinised in a pedantic manner or in a manner completely divorced from common sense.\\nAs was stated by Pollock C. B. in Jones vs Nicholls(3) We must impprt a little common sense into notices of this kind '.\\nBeaumonth, C.J., also observed in Chandu Lal Vadilal vs Government of Bombay(4) \\\"One must construe section 80 with some regard to common sense and to the object with which it appears to have been passed. .\\\" As already pointed out, the suit was instituted in the present case by the divided members of Hindu joint family on 20th July, 1954.\\nThe notice had been given on 11th January, 1954 by Beohar Raghubir Singh who was the karta of the undivided joint family.\\nIn our opinion there was identity between the person giving a notice and the persons filing the suit because it must be deemed in law that each of the plaintiffs had given the notice under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code through the karta Beohar Raghubir Singh.\\nIt is not disputed that the cause of action set out in the notice remained unchanged in the suit.\\nIt is also not said that the relief set out in the plaint is different from the relief set out in the notice.\\nWe are accordingly of the opinion that the notice given by the karta was sufficient to sustain the suit brought by the divided coparceners and the decision of the High Court on this point must be over ruled.\\nThe view that we have expressed is borne out by the judgment of this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh vs Gundugola Venkata Suryanarayan Garu(5).\\nIn that case, the Government of Madras applied the provisions of the Madras Estates Rent Reduction Act, 1947 to the lands in the village Mallindhapuram on the ground that the grant was of the whole village and hence an estate within the meaning of section 3 (2) (d)of the Madras Estates (1) ; (2) [1927] L.R. 54 I.A. 338.\\n(3) ; , 363; ; ,150.(4) I.L.R. (5) ; 961 Land Act, 1908.\\nThe respondent and another person served a notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure upon the Government of the State of Madras in which they challenged the above mentioned notification and asked the Government not to act upon it.\\nOut of the two persons who gave the notice, the respondent alone filed the suit.\\nThe trial court held that the original grant was not of the entire village and was not so confirmed or recognised by the Government of Madras and as it was not an \\\"Estate\\\" within the meaning of section 3 (2) (d) of the Madras Estates Land Act, the Madras Rent Reduction Act, 1947 did not apply to it.\\nBut the suit was dismissed on the ground that although two persons had given notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only one person had filed the suit.\\nThe High Court agreed with the trial court that the grant was not of an entire village but it also held that the notice was not defective and the suit was maintainable as it was a representative suit and the permission of the Court under 0.1, r. 8 had been obtained in this case.\\nThe High Court granted the respondent the relief prayed for 'by him.\\nAgainst the order of the High Court the appellant appealed to this Court which dismissed the appeal holding that in the circumstances of the case there was no illegality even though the notice was given by two persons and the suit was filed by only one.\\nIf the Court grants permission to one person to institute a representative suit and if the person had served the notice under section 80, the circumstance that another person had joined him in serving the notice but did not join him in the suit, was not a sufficient ground for regarding the suit as defective.\\nAt page 953 of the Report Shah, J. observed as follows : \\\"The notice in the, present suit was served by the plaintiff and Yegneswara Sastri.\\nThey raised a grievance about the notification issued by the Government of Madras on May 16, 1950; it was not an individual grievance of the two persons who served the notice but of all the Inamdars or agrahamdars.\\nThe relief for which the suit was intended to be filed was also not restricted to their personal claim.\\nThe notice stated the cause of action arising in favour of all the Inamdars, and it is not disputed that the notice set out the relief which would be claimable by all the Inamdars or on their behalf in default of compliance with the requisition.\\nThe plaintiff it is true alone filed the suit, but he was permitted to sue for and on behalf of ' all the Inamdars by an order of the Court unuder O. 1, r. 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\\nThe requirements as to the cause of action, the name, description and place of residence of the plaintiff was therefore 962 complied with and the relief which the plaintiff claimed was duly set out in the notice.\\nThe only departure from the notice was that two persons served a notice under section 80 informing the Government that proceedings would be started, in default of compliance with the requisition, for violation of the rights of the Inamdars, and one person only out of the two instituted the suit.\\nThat in our judgment is not a defect which brings the case within the terms of section 80\\\".\\nOn behalf of respondent No. 1 reference was made, to the two decisions of the Judicial Committee in Vellayan Chettiar & Ors.\\nvs Government of the Province of Madras and Anr.(1) and Government of the Province of Bombay vs Pestonji Ardeshir Wadia & Ors.(2) But the 'principle of these decisions has no bearing on the question presented for determination in the present case.\\nIn Vellayan Chettiar 's case(1) a notice was given by one plaintiff stating the cause of action, his name, description and place of his residence and the relief which he claimed although the suit was instituted by him and another.\\nIt was observed by the Judicial Committee: \\\"The section according to its plain meaning requires that there should be in the language of the High Court of Madras 'identity of the person who issues the notice with the person who brings the suit ' : See Venkata Rangiah Appa Rao vs Secretary of State(3) and on appeal Venkata Rangiah Appa Rao vs Secretary of State (4).\\nTo hold otherwise would be to admit an implication or exception for which there is no jurisdiction\\\" Two persons had sued for a declaration that certain lands belonged to them, and for an order setting aside the decision of the Appellate Survey Officer in regard to those lands.\\nIt was found that one alone out of the two persons had served the notice.\\nThe relief claimed by the two persons was personal to them and the right thereto arose out of their title to the land claimed by them.\\nIt was held by the Judicial Committee that without a proper notice under section 80 the suit could not be instituted for to hold otherwise would be to admit an, implication or exception for which there was no justification.\\nIn the other case, in Pestonji Ardeshir Wadia 's case(2) two trustees of a trust served a notice in October, 1933 upon the Government of Bombay under section 80 intimating that the trustees intended to institute a suit against the Government on the cause of action and for the relief set out (1) A.I.R. 1947 P.C. 197.\\n(2) 76 I.A. 85.\\n(3) I.L.R. Mad 416.\\n(4) 963 therein.\\nOne of the trustees died before the plaint was lodged in court, and two more trustees were appointed in the place of the deceased trustee.\\nThereafter the two now trustees and the surviving trustee filed the suit out of which the appeal arose which was decided by the Judicial Committee.\\nNo notice was served on the Government on behalf of the two new trustees.\\nThe Judicial Committee accepted the view of the High Court that where there were three plaintiffs, the names and addresses of all of them must be given in the notice.\\nTheir Lordships observed that : \\\"the provisions of section 80 of the Code are imperative and should be strictly complied with before it can be said that a notice valid in law has been served on the Government.\\nIn the present case it is not contended that any notice on behalf of plaintiffs 2 and 3 was served on the Government before the filing of the suit\\\".\\nIt is clear that the principle of these two decisions of the Judicial Committee has no application in the present case because the material facts are different.\\nWe proceed to consider the next question arising in these appeals viz., whether the High Court was right in holding that the plaintiffs had established their title as raiyat sarkar with regard to 1/5th share in nazul plots Nos.\\n34/3, 33 and 171/1 mentioned in the Deputy Commissioner 's order dated 7th May, 1948 in Revenue Case No. 9/45 46.\\nIt was argued on behalf of defendant No. 1 that there was no evidence to show that the plaintiffs were in possession of the land from 1909 to 1932, and the plaintiffs had not established their title by prescription for the statutory period of 60 years.\\nIt was contended that the High Court had no justification for holding that the plaintiffs had established the title of \\\"Raiyat Sarkar\\\" and the finding of the High Court was not based upon any evidence.\\nIn our opinion, the argument put forward on behalf of defendant No. 1 is wellfounded and must be accepted as correct.\\nIn the settlement of the names of Amansingh and Thakurprasad were noted in the remarks column.\\nBut the column regarding tenancy right is definitely blank.\\nThe owner is shown in the Khasra as the State \\\"Milkiat Sarkar\\\".\\nIn the settlement of 189091 Amansingh Narpatsingh is again shown in the remarks column of the khata.\\nBut the column regarding any kind of tenancy right is again blank.\\nIt is clear that in the settlements of 1860 and 1890 91 the ownership of the land is recorded as that of the Government.\\nThe possession of the plaintiffs or of their ancestors could not be attributed to ownership or tenancy right of the property.\\nIn the settlement of 1909 10, exhibit\\nP 3 there is no entry in the remarks column showing the possession of the ancestors of the plaintiffs.\\nIt was said on behalf of the plaintiffs that no (1) 76 I.A. 85.\\nL11 Sup.\\nC.I./69 12 96 4 notice was given to them of the proceedings of the. settlement of 1909 10.\\nEven assuming that this allegation is correct, the entries of the khasra P 3 cannot be treated to be a nullity and of no effect.\\nIn any event, it was open to the plaintiffs to adduce other reliable evidence to prove their possession between the years 1909 to 1932.\\nBut the plaintiffs have failed to produce any such evidence.\\nln the nazul settlement of 1922 23 the tank was given new plot numbers 33, 34, 35,36, 37 and 171 and its area was recorded as 5.24 acres.\\nIn this settlement about 2 acres of land was found to be occupied by the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur.\\nThe land so found to be occupied was recorded in the possession of the Municipal Committee, Jabalpur and the remaining land was again recorded as \\\"Milkiat Sarkar\\\".\\nThere is no entry as regards the remaining land recording anybody 's possession in the.\\nremarks column.\\nActually proclamations were made during this settlement and objections were invited as per exhibit\\nID 14.\\nA date was fixed upto 31 8 1924 but no one came forward.\\nThe proclamation clearly recited that the vacant sites which were not in possession of anybody were not recognised as belonging to any person.\\nIt is impossible to believe that the plaintiffs or their ancestors were unaware of such a proclamation.\\nHad they been in possession they would not have failed to make a claim.\\nFor the period after 1933 34 the plaintiffs produced account books to show that they exercised certain rights.\\nCertain receipts were also proved but they also relate to a period after 1939.\\nWe have gone through the oral evidence produced by the plaintiffs and it appears to be unreliable.\\nThe result is that for the period 1891 till 1932 there is no reliable oral or documentary evidence to prove that the plaintiffs or their ancestors had any possession over the disputed land.\\nOn the contrary the disputed land i.e. Phoota Tal was always recognised as Milkiat Sarkar and the State Government was justified in holding that the order of the Deputy Commissioner dated 7th May, 1948 should be set aside.\\nIn the course of the argument reference was made by Mr. Gupte to the following passage in the Central Provinces Settlement Instructions (Reprint of 1953) page 213 \\\"In dealing with proposed method of the settlement of titles it will be convenient in order to remove all causes for misapprehension among residents, to lay emphasis on the policy of Government in making these settlements.\\nThat policy was defined in the Chief Commissioner 's Resolution No. 502 B X dated the 19th October, 1917, in the Revenue & Scarcity Department, but its main principles will bear repetition.\\nAs it is not the intention of Government in making the settlement to disturb long possession, but only to 965 obtain an accurate record of the lands which are its property and to secure its right to any land revenue to which it may be entitled, long possession even without clear proof of a definite grant from Government will be recognised as entitled the holder to possession.\\nIn deciding what constitutes long possession in any individual town, regard will be had to the special circumstances of the place, and while this point will be dealt with more particularly in the Deputy Commissioner 's report, the following general principles will ordinarily be observed : (1) all occupants who are able to prove possession to any land prior to 1891 or such later date as may be fixed for each town, either by themselves or by a valid title from a previous holder, and all occupants who can prove a definite grant or lease from Government will be recorded as entitled to hold such land as against Government (paragraph 6 of the Resolution) On the basis of this passage it was argued that it was the duty of the settlement officer to treat the plaintiffs as having established their title because they were shown to be in possession in the settlement of the year 1890 91.\\nWe are unable to accept this argument as correct.\\nThe passage quoted above only applies to a case where the ownership of the land was unknown i.e. where possession is proved for a long time, but its original title could not be traced, and not to a case where the land is recorded as Government land.\\nFor the reasons expressed, we hold that the suit brought by the plaintiffs being Civil Suit No. 10 A of 1954 should be dismissed.\\nCivil Appeal 386 of 1966 is accordingly dismissed and Civil Appeal 387 of 1966 is allowed with costs in favour of defendant No. 1 i.e. State of Madhya Pradesh.\\nThere will be one hearing fee.\\nR.K.P.S.

Achar, for the intervener.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by Wanchoo, J.\\nThis is an appeal on a certificate granted by the Mysore High Court.\\nThe appellant was prosecuted under section 167 (81) of the Sea Customs Act (No. 8 of 1878) read with section 9 of the Land Customs Act (No. 19 of 1924).\\nThe appellant lives in a village which is close to Goa.\\nThe incident out of which the present appeal has arisen took place on November 27, 1960 when Goa was not a part of India but was Portuguese territory.\\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Customs, Goa Frontier Division, Belgaum received information that contraband goods would be found in the house of the appellant.\\nConsequently he raided the house in the company of three panchas.\\nThe appellant was not present in the house when the raid took place, but his mother and sisterin law were there.\\nAfter necessary formalities the house was searched and a big steel trunk, a cane box and another steel trunk were taken down from the loft in the kitchen.\\nOn opening, a belt, with four pouches stitched to it, was found in the big steel trunk.\\nInside the pouches, four gold bars with foreign marks and labels of Goa Customs authorities were found.\\nBesides these, a large sum of money and three small cut pieces of gold were also found in the box.\\nIn the other two boxes also various sums of money in currency notes were found.\\nThe weight of the gold bars was 343 tolas.\\nOn November 30, 1960, the appellant was arrested and inter rogated by the Deputy Superintendent of Customs and Excise.\\nThe answers given by him were reduced in writing and his signature was taken on the writing after it had been read over to him.\\nDuring this interrogation, the appellant admitted that the four gold bars had been given to him on November 27, 1960 in the moming by one Vittal Morajkar of Goa so that he might deliver them back to Morajkar on the motor stand at Belgaum or near there, and be had kept them in his house.\\nAs the gold was foreign gold 700 and as under the notification under section 8(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, import of gold into India had been for,bidden except with the general or special permission of the Reserve Bank of India, the appellant was prosecuted on a complaint filed by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise and Land Customs, Goa Frontier Division, Belgaum.\\nThe Magistrate convicted the appellant and sentenced him to imprisonment and fine and also ordered confiscation of the four gold bars.\\nOn appeal to the Sessions Judge, the appellant was acquitted relying on the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Sitaram Agarwala vs State(1).\\nThen followed an appeal by the State to the High Court.\\nThe High Court disagreed with the view takeu by the Calcutta High Court in Sitaram Agarwal 's case(1) and held that even a person like the appellant who might have no direct concern with the import of gold in any way was liable under section 167(81) of the Sea Customs Act.\\nThe High Court then ,considered the evidence and relying on the statement made by the appellant to the Deputy Superintendent of Customs and Excise and also on the other evidence produced in the case held that the appellant was guilty.\\nIn consequence, the acquittal of the appellant was set aside and the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Magistrate was restored.\\nThe appellant then applied to the High Court for a certificate to appeal to this Court, and as two questions of law of general importance arose in this case, the High Court granted the certificate.\\nThe two questions were : (1) whether the view taken by the High Court differing from the view taken by the Calcutta High Court in Sitaram Agarwal 's case(1) with respect to the interpretation of section 167(81) was correct, and (ii) whether the statement made by the appellant to the Deputy Superintendent of Customs and Excise was admissible in evidence in view of section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act (No. 1 of 1872).\\nThese are the two questions which have been argued before us on behalf ,of the appellant in the present appeal.\\nSo far as the first question is concerned, namely, the interpretation of section 167(81) of the Sea Customs Act, the matter is now settled by the decision of this Court in Sachidananda 'Bannerjee, Assistant Collector of Customs vs Sitaram Agarwal and another(2).\\nThis Court has held therein that the interpretation put by the Calcutta High Court in the case of Sitaram Agarwala(1) is not correct and that section 167(81) of the Sea Customs Act can also take in persons who may not be concerned the actual import of prohibited goods.\\nThe view taken by the Mysore High Court is in accordance with the view taken by this Court in that appeal and in view of that,, learned counsel for the appellant has admitted (1) (2) 701 that the appellant would be guilty within the meaning of section 167 (81) of the Sea Customs Act.\\nThis leaves only the second question, and it has been urged on behalf of the appellant that a Central Excise Officer under the Central Excises and Salt Act, No. I of 1944 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) is a police officer within the meaning of those words in section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nTherefore even though the Deputy Superintendent of Customs and Central Excises may have acted under the powers conferred on him by the Sea Customs Act, he was still a police officer, and the statement made to him by the appellant on November 30, 1960 which is in the nature of a confession would be inadmissible under section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nIt may be added that the High Court had in this connection relied on the judgment of this Court in the State of Punjab vs Barkat Ram( ) where it had been held by majority that a Customs.\\nOfficer under the Sea Customs Act was not a police officer within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nThe appellant however relies on a later decision of this Court in Raja Ram Jaiswal vs State of Bihar(2) where by majority it was held that an excise officer under the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act (No. 2 of 1915) was a police officer within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nThere has been difference of opinion among the High Courts in India as to the meaning of the words \\\"police officer\\\" used in section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nOne view has been that those words must be construed in a broad way and all officers whether they are police officers properly so called or not would be police officers within the meaning of those words if they have all the powers of a police officer with respect to investigation of offences with which they are concerned.\\nThe leading case in support of this view is Nanoo, Sheikh Ahmed vs Emperor(3).\\nThe other view which may be called the narrow view is that the words \\\"police officer\\\" in section 25 of the Evidence Act mean a police officer properly so called and do not include officers of other departments of government who may be charged with the duty to investigate under special Acts special crimes thereunder like excise offences or customs offences, and so on.\\nThe leading case in support of this view is Radha Kishun Marwari vs King Emperor(4).\\nThe other High Courts have followed one view or the other, the majority being in favour of the view taken by the Bombay High Court.\\nIt is submitted on behalf 'of the appellant that the view taken by the Bombay High Court in Nanoo Sheikh Ahmed(3) is the correct view and that the view of the Patna High Court in Radha Kishun Marwari(4) is not correct.\\nOn the other hand it has been urged on behalf of the State that the view taken by the Patna High (1) ; (2) [1964]2 S.C.R. 752.\\n(3) Bom.\\n(4) patna 46.\\nC.1./66 13 702 Court in Radha Kishun Marwari(1) is the correct one.\\nPrima facie there is in our opinion much to be said for the narrow view taken by the Patna High Court.\\nBut as we have come to the conclusion that even in the broad view, a Central Excise Officer under the Act is not a police officer, it is unnecessary to express a final opinion on the two views on the meaning of the words \\\"police officer\\\" in section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nWe shall proceed on the assumption that the broad view ' may be accepted and that requires an examination of the various provisions of the Act to which we turn now.\\nThe main purpose of the Act is to levy and collect excise duties and Central Excise Officers have been appointed thereunder for this main purpose.\\nIn order that they may carry out their duties in this behalf, powers have been conferred on them to see that duty is not evaded and persons guilty of evasion of duty are brought to book.\\nSection 9 of the Act provides for punishment which may extend to imprisonment upto 6 months or to find upto Rs. 2,000 or both where a person (a) contravenes any of the provisions of a notification issued under section 6 or of section 8 or of a rule made under cl.\\n(iii) of sub section (2) of section 37; (b) evades the payment of any duty payable under the Act; (c) fails to supply any information which he is required by rules made under the Act to supply or supplies false information; and (d) attempts to commit or abets the commission of any of the offences mentioned in cls.\\n(a) and (b) above.\\nUnder section 13 of the Act, any Central Excise Officer duly empowered by the Central Government in this behalf may arrest any person whom he has reason to.\\nbelieve to be liable to punishment under the Act.\\nSection 18 lays down that all searches made under the Act or any rules made thereunder and all arrests made under the Act shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 relating respectively to searches and arrests made under that Code.\\nSection 19 lays down that every person arrested under the Act shall be forwarded without delay to the nearest Central Excise Officer empowered to send persons so arrested to a Magistrate, or, if there is no such Central Excise Officer within a reasonable distance, to the officer in charge of the nearest police station.\\nThese sections clearly show that the powers of arrest and search conferred on Central Excise Officers are really in support of their main function of levy and collection of duty on excisable goods.\\nStrong reliance has however been placed on behalf of the appellant on section 21 of the Act, the material part of which runs thus: \\\"21.\\n(1) When any person is forwarded under section 19 to a Central Excise Officer empowered to send persons so (1) Patna 46.\\n703 arrested to a Magistrate, the Central Excise Officer shall proceed to inquire into the charge against him.\\n(2)For this purpose the Central Excise Officer may exercise the same powers and shall be subject to the same provisions as the officer in charge of a police station may exercise and is subject to under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, when investigating a cognizable case; Provided that. . . . . . \\\" It is urged that under sub section (2) of section 21 a Central Excise Officer under the Act has all the powers of an officer in charge of a police station under chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure and therefore he must be deemed to be a police officer within the meaning of those words in section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nIt is true that sub section (2) confers on the Central Excise Officer under the Act the same powers as an officer in charge of a police station has when investigating a cognizable case; but this power is conferred for the purpose of sub section\\n(1) which gives power to a Central Excise Officer to whom any arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the charge against him.\\nThus under section 21 it is the duty of the Central Excise Officer to whom an arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the charge made against such person.\\nFurther under proviso (a) to sub section\\n(2)of section 21 if the Central Excise Officer is of opinion that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused person, he shall either admit him to bail to appear before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case, or forward him in custody to such.\\nMagistrate.\\nIt does not however appear that a Central Excise Officer under the Act has power to submit a charge sheet under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\nUnder section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a Magistrate can take cognizance of any offence either (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence, of (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer, or (c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has been committed.\\nA police officer for purposes of cl.\\n(b) above can in our opinion only be a police officer properly so called as the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure shows and it seems therefore that a Central Excise Officer will have to make a complaint under cl.\\n(a) above if he wants the Magistrate to take cognizance of an offence, for \\\"ample, under section 9 of the Act.\\nThus though under sub section (2) of section 21 of the Central Excise Officer under the Act has the powers of an officer incharge of a police station when investigating a cognizable case, that is for the purpose of his inquiry under sub section\\n(1) of section 21.\\nSection 21 is in terms different fro section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act,1915 which came to be considered in Raja Ram Jaiswal 's 704 case(1) and which provided in terms that \\\"for the purposes of section 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, the area to which an excise officer empowered under section 77, sub section (2) , is appointed shall be deemed to be a police station, and such officer shall be deemed to be the officer in charge of such station\\\".\\nIt cannot therefore be said that the provision in section 21 is on par with the provision in section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act.\\nAll that section 21 provides is that for the purpose of his enquiry, a Central Excise Officer shall have the powers of an officerin charge of a police station when investigating a cognizable case.\\nBut even so it appears that these powers do not include the power to submit a charge sheet under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for unlike the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, the Central Excise Officer is not deemed to be an officer in charge of a police station.\\nIt has been urged before us that if we consider section 21 in the setting of section 14 of the Act, it would become clear that the enquiry contemplated under section 21(1) is in substance different from investigation pure and simple into an offence under the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\nIt is not necessary to decide whether the enquiry under section 14 must also include enquiry mentioned in section 21 of the Act.\\nApart from this argument we are of the opinion that mere conferment of powers of investigation into criminal offences under section 9 of the Act does not make the Central Excise Officer, a police officer even in the broader view mentioned above.\\nOtherwise any person entrusted with investigation under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would become a police officer.\\nIn any case unlike the provisions of section 78(3) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915, section 21 (2) of the Act does not say that the Central Excise Officer shall be deemed to be an officer in charge of a police station and the area under his charge shall be deemed to be a police station.\\nAll that section 21 does is to give him certain powers to aid him in his enquiry.\\nIn these circumstances we are of opinion that even though the Central Excise Officer may have when making enquiries for purposes of the Act powers which an officer in charge of a police station has when investigating a cognizable offence, he does not thereby become a police officer even if we give the broader meaning to those words in section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nThe scheme of the Act therefore being different from the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915, the appellant cannot take advantage of the decision of this Court in Raja Ram Jaiswals ' case(1) taking even the broader view of the words \\\"police officer\\\" in section 25 of the Evidence Act.\\nWe are of opinion that the present case is more in accord with the case of Barkat Ram(2).\\nIn this view, (1) ; , (2) ; 705 of the matter the statement made by the appellant to the Deputy Superintendent of Customs and Excise would not be hit by section 25 of the Evidence Act and would be admissible in evidence unless the appellant can take advantage of section 24 of the Evidence Act.\\nAs to that it was urged on behalf of the appellant in the High Court that the confessional statement was obtained by threats.\\nThis was not accepted by the High Court and therefore section 24 of the Evidence Act has no application in the present case.\\nIt is not disputed that if this statement is admissible, the conviction of the appellant is correct.\\nAs we have held that a Central Excise Officer is not a police officer within the meaning of those words in section 25 of the Evidence Act the appellant 's statement is admissible.\\nIt is not ruled out by anything in section 24 of the Evidence Act and so the appellant 's conviction is correct and the appeal must be dismissed.\\nWe hereby dismiss the appeal.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"Civil Appeal No. 1712 of 1973.\\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 20 5

Ltd. and 225 shares of Rs. 100/ in Maya Press Pvt.\\nLtd. held by the deceased.\\nThe Assistant Controller of Estate Duty did not accept this part of the return and included 2002 shares in Mitra Prakashan Pvt. Ltd. and 1602 shares in Maya Press Pvt.\\nLtd. standing in the name of Smt.\\nN. Mitra, wife of the deceased, 947 and his three sons, Aloke Mitra, Ashoke Mitra and Deepak Mitra, brother in law B.N. Ghosh and an ex employee, R.N. Misra since they were holding these shares benami.\\nHe accordingly included the value of these shares in the principal value of the estate of the deceased.\\nHis order was affirmed in appeal by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, that is, the Appellate Tribunal.\\nUnder section 64(1) of the Act the Appellate Tribunal referred the question whether the shares allotted to the wife of the deceased as his nominee or as benamidar, were, as from the commencement of the held by her as a full owner thereof by virtue of provisions of section 14 of that Act.\\nAccording to the High Court, the said question did not at all arise.\\nOn the finding that the transaction was benami and that the deceased was the real owner of the shares, the wife must be held to have no interest or title to the shares.\\nShe was merely a benamidar or name lender.\\nSince she had no interest at all, the provisions of section 14 of the were not attracted as she was not possessed of any right or title.\\nThe material facts of the case may now be stated.\\nThe deceased carried on the business of printer and publisher under the name and style of Maya Press.\\nIn 1953, his brother in law, B.N. Ghosh alongwith some other persons floated two companies, Mitra Prakashan Pvt. Ltd. and Maya Press Pvt. Ltd.\\nUnder an agreement dated May 29, 1953 the deceased agreed to transfer his publishing business to Mitra Prakashan Pvt. Ltd. for a consideration of Rs. 2,07,500 and the printing business to Maya Press Pvt. Ltd. for Rs. 1,64,800.\\nIt was agreed that the consideration would be paid by Mitra Prakashan Pvt. Ltd. in the form of cash to the extent of Rs. 7,500/ and the balance by allotting 2000 fully paid up shares of the value of Rs. 100/ each to the deceased or his nominees.\\nThe other company, namely Maya Press Pvt.\\nLtd. agreed to pay Rs. 4,800/ in cash and the balance of Rs. 1,60,000 in the form of 1600 fully paid up shares of the value of Rs. 100/ each to be allotted in the name of the deceased or his nominees.\\nIn pursuance of this agreement, the business of Maya Press was transferred by the deceased on July 1, 1953 to the two companies.\\nOn January 24, 1954 the deceased wrote to the two companies letters intimating that the shares be allotted to his wife Smt.\\nN. Mitra, three sons Aloke Mitra, Ashoke Mitra, Deepak Mitra, brother in law B.N. Ghosh and and employee, R.N. Misra.\\nThe companies allotted the shares accordingly.\\nThey in addition allotted two more shares to the deceased.\\nThus, 502 shares were held by the deceased in his own name in Mitra Prakashan Pvt. Ltd. and 225 shares in Maya Press 948 Pvt.\\nLtd. The rest were held by his wife, sons, brother in law and an ex employee.\\nIt has been found that the total number of shares issued by the two companies was 2006 by the Mitra Prakashan Pvt. Ltd. and 1605 by Maya Press Pvt.\\nLtd. Out of these 2002 and 1602 shares respectively were held by the deceased and his nominees.\\nThe deceased by transferring his personal printing and publishing business to the two new companies had thus become through himself or his nominees practically the exclusive owner of these two companies.\\nIt is an admitted fact that the deceased supplied the entire consideration for the purchase of these 2002 and 1602 shares and that his wife, sons, brother in law or the ex employee did not make any contribution for their acquisition.\\nOn these facts, both the Assistant Controller of Estate Duty as well as the Appellate Tribunal held that the share scrips standing in the name of the wife of the deceased and his sons, brother in law and the ex employee really belonged to the deceased as they were mere benamidars and, therefore, included the value of the shares held by the deceased in the name of his wife and sons etc.\\nin the principal value of the estate passing on his death.\\nThe true legal effect of the finding of the Appellate Tribunal is this: Smt.\\nN. Mitra, wife of the deceased, his three sons, brother in law and the ex employee held the shares benami for the benefit of the deceased.\\nThey were, therefore, the benamidars of the deceased.\\nWhile upholding the order of the Assistant Controller, the Central Board of Direct Taxes observed that the mere fact that the subject matter was the shares in the two companies would not throw any more onus of proof on the Assistant Controller than would be thrown if the subject matter was some other property.\\nWhen money was paid by the deceased, it was for the accountable person to prove the gift.\\nThe deceased had clearly mentioned in the letters dated January 24, 1954 to the two companies that the shares should be issued and allotted in the names of the persons nominated by him.\\nIf the deceased intended to make an outright gift of these shares, he would have very well said so in the letters.\\nThere being no presumption of advancement, the mere fact that the shares were got issued in their names without making any indication of gift, would not make the nominees recipients of any gift.\\nUsing of names of benamidars for holding of shares in companies was as common as for any other type of property.\\nAs regards the enjoyment of the income of these shares, it observed that there was no clear evidence to show that the money was actually used by the nominees.\\nIt appeared that the dividends were only credited by book entry to the 949 personal accounts of the deceased, Aloke Mitra and the deceased 's wife the account of the deceased 's wife was also credited with dividends in the names of others than Aloke Mitra.\\nThere was nothing to show that before the death of the deceased these amounts were actually withdrawn and utilised by the persons to whom they were supposed to belong.\\nWhatever was done after the death of the deceased may, by agreement between the heirs, have been adjusted in the allocation of other assets, and obviously could not be of any legal effect in determining the question whether the shares belonged to the deceased.\\nAs already stated, the only question of law in the opinion of the Appellate Tribunal which could be referred under section 64(1) of the Act, was whether the shares allotted to the wife of the deceased as his nominee or as benamidar were, as from the commencement of the held by her as full owner thereof by virtue of the provisions of section 14 of that Act.\\nBut it declined to make a reference on the other questions, holding that the finding that the shares were held by the deceased in the name of his wife and sons etc.\\nbenami, was a finding of fact and it did not give rise to any question of law.\\nThe accountable person being dissatisfied moved the High Court under section 64(3) and it directed the Tribunal to draw up a supplementary statement of the case and refer two other questions of law said to arise from its order.\\nWhen the reference came up before the High Court, it declined to answer questions other than those which were questions of law.\\nIt refused to be drawn into the question of benami, which was purely one of fact, and not one of mixed law and fact and, therefore, following the decision of this Court in Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. vs C.I.T. held that the finding was not open to review under section 64(1) of the Act.\\nIn answering the reference in the negative and against the Controller of Estate Duty, and in favour of the accountable person, the High Court merely observed 'As at present advised ' and preferred to follow the two decisions of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Smt.\\nShantabai Jadhav vs Controller of Estate Duty and Smt.\\nDenabai Bomab Shah vs Controller of Estate Duty taking a view to the contrary.\\nThere is no discussion in the judgment at all and it seems that its attention was not drawn to section 5(1) of the Act.\\nFollowing the view in Smt.\\nShantabai Jadhav 's case and Smt.\\nDenabai Bomab Shah 's case the High Court observed that since the shares 950 stood in the name of the wife and sons etc.\\nbenami for the deceased, the deceased had no power to transfer since he had not obtained a release from the benamidars or a declaration from an appropriate court.\\nOn this wrongful assumption, the High Court held that the deceased remained incompetent to transfer the shares till his death, and so, the property in them would not be deemed to pass upon his death by reason of section 6 and, therefore, they were not includible in the estate of the deceased under section 5(1) of the Act.\\nIn Controller of Estate Duty, U.P. vs T.N. Kochhar the High Court following the judgment under appeal, observed: \\\"It is well settled that the property which stands benami in the name of another is one in respect of which the beneficial owner has no competency to dispose of.\\nBefore he can dispose of such a property he has to acquire a declaration from the appropriate court of law releasing the property in his favour.\\n\\\" The High Court seems to assume that there is some interrelation between sections 5 and 6.\\nIt has held that though the shares in question really belonged to the deceased, they would not, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, constitute property which 'passed ' on the death of the deceased for the purpose of section 5(1) of the Act since the shares stood in the name of wife and sons etc.\\nbenami for the deceased, but he had only beneficial interest therein inasmuch as the deceased was at the time of his death not competent to dispose of the shares and they could not be 'deemed to pass ' under section 6 of the Act.\\nThe main question involved in the appeal is whether in the case of a benami transaction, the value of the property held by a benamidar passes upon the death of the real owner and is includible in the estate of the deceased under section 5 of the Act, or being so held by the benamidar, it cannot be deemed to pass on his death because of section 6 of the Act and, therefore, the value of such property cannot be included in the principal value of the estate of the deceased.\\nThat depends upon the precise effect of section 5(1) and section 6 and their relation ship to one another namely, whether the chargeability of estate duty under section 5(1) of the Act, is limited and controlled by section 6.\\nThe imposes a tax upon the principal value of all properties, settled or not settled, passing on death or deemed to pass on death.\\nEstate duty is chargeable at percentage rates rising with the value of the estate on all property passing on 951 death, including property of which the deceased was competent to dispose and gifts made within limited period before death.\\nPrimary liability falls on the deceased 's estate.\\nThe charging section is sub section\\n(1) of section 5 which provides that in case of a person dying after the commencement of the Act, estate duty is leviable on the capital value of all property, settled or not settled which 'passes ' on death at the rates fixed in accordance with section 35.\\nThat is followed by a group of sections, sections 6 to 15, which relate to the levy of estate duty on properties which by the Act are 'deemed to pass ' on death.\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is provided by sub section\\n(3) of section 3 that references in the Act to property passing on death of a person shall be construed as including references to property deemed to pass on the death of such person.\\nThe expression 'property passing on death ' is defined in section 2(16) to include property passing immediately on death.\\nIn general, the word 'passes ' may be taken as meaning 'changing hands on death ' regardless of its destination.\\nSection 6 of the Act, upon which the controversy turns, provides: \\\"6.\\nProperty which the deceased was at the time of his death competent to dispose of shall be deemed to pass on his death.\\n\\\" By no rule of construction can the operation of sub section (1) of section 5 of the Act be curtailed by the operation of section 6.\\nIt is in addition to or supplemental of, the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5, which is the charging section.\\nAs a matter of construction, two views are possible.\\nOne view is that the two sections are mutually exclusive and they have independent fields of operation.\\nWhenever property changes hands on death, the State is entitled to step in and take a toll of the property as it passed without regard to its destination or to the degree of relationship, if any, that may have subsisted between the deceased and the person or persons succeeding.\\nSection 5(1) gives effect to that principle and it imposes a duty called estate duty upon the principal value of all property, settled or not settled, which passes on death.\\nSection 6 does not apply to property of which the deceased was competent to dispose of and which passes on his death; it applies only to property which does not pass on his death but of which he was competent to dispose.\\nSections 5(1) and 6 being mutually exclusive, the application of section 5 accordingly precludes recourse to section 6.\\nThe other and the better view appears to be that section 5(1) alone 952 is capable of imposing a charge of duty and where both section 5(1) and section 6 apply, the property would still be dutiable under both concurrently.\\nSection 6 is merely subsidiary and supplementary and it declares that the expression 'property passing on the death of the deceased ' shall be 'deemed to include property which the deceased was competent to dispose of '.\\nWhen section 6 has brought property within the charge of duty 'either alone ' as in the case of competency to dispose of under section 6, which could not be supposed to 'pass on death ' or concurrently with section 5, its function is at an end.\\nIn England, the Finance Act, 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 30) imposed by section 1 estate duty 'upon the principal value ascertained as hereafter provided of all property, real or personal, settled or not settled which passed on the death ' of a person dying after the commencement of the Act.\\nBy section 2, sub section\\n(1) 'property passing on the death of the deceased ' shall be deemed to include categories of properties specified therein.\\nThe precise relationship between sections 1 and 2, before the law was amended in 1969, was a question on which judicial opinion fluctuated widely.\\nFor over 60 years, they were regarded as mutually exclusive and having independent fields of operation; the view was that property could not be liable to duty concurrently.\\nIn a situation where both sections 1 and 2 might apply, section 1 took priority and excluded section 2 liability.\\nIt was laid down by the House of Lords, in a series of cases, that section 2(1) was not a definition section, explanatory of section 1, but an independent section operating outside the field of section 1: Earl Cowley vs Inland Revenue Commissioners, Attorney General vs Milne, Nevill vs Inland Revenue Commissioners.\\nIn Earl Cowley 's case the House of Lords reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, held that if the case fell within section 1, it went out of the purview of section 2.\\nLord Macnaghten after observing that section 1 contained the pith and substance of the enactment, stated: \\\"It is comprehensive, broad and clear. .\\nThe first question as it seems to me the question that lies at the very threshold of our inquiry is simply this: Under which section of the Finance Act 1894 does the present case fall? Is it the ordinary and normal case of property passing on death, or is it one of those exceptional cases in which property is deemed to pass, though there is no passing of property in fact? Does it come under section 1 or under section 2?\\\" 953 After differing from the Court of Appeal, he went on to say: \\\"What the Act has in view for the purpose of taxation is property passing on death,.\\nNow, if the case falls within section 1 it cannot also come within section 2.\\nThe two sections are mutually exclusive.\\nIn my opinion the two sections are quite distinct, and section 2 throws no light on section 1.\\nBut section 2 does not apply to an interest in property which passes on the death of the deceased.\\nThat is already dealt with in the earlier section .\\nThat is section 1.\\nYou do not want section 2 for that.\\nYou cannot resort to section 2.\\nFor that would be giving the duty twice over.\\nThe Crown cannot have it both ways.\\nDouble duty is forbidden by the Act.\\\" (Emphasis supplied) The ratio decidendi in Earl Cowley 's case was that if a case fell within section 1 without the aid of section 2(1), one is not concerned with section 2(1).\\nLord Macnaghten 's exposition of the inter relation of sections 1 and 2 in Earl Cowley 's case contained the essential characteristics of a statement of legal principle; it was expressed in very precise language, and with a confidence that excluded the possibility of any alternative view.\\nIn Attorney General vs Milne (supra) Lord Haldane, after referring to Earl Cowley 's case, said: \\\"Section 2 is thus not a definition section, but an independent section operating outside the field of section 1.\\\" Lord Atkinson, however, adopted Lord Haldane 's earlier view, treating section 2 as merely supplementary to section 1, and as designed to make liable to estate duty certain dispositions of property which were outside the scope and beyond the reach of section 1. \\\"This section\\\", he said, \\\"is not a definition section\\\".\\nHe did not, however, say (and that is significant) that the two sections were mutually exclusive.\\nLord Dunedin took a different view.\\nHaving said that whether Lord Macnaghten was strictly correct or not in saying that whether the two sections were mutually exclusive or not seemed to him to matter little, he added: \\\"It seems to me that that is as much as to say that the words, 'property passing on the death ', in the first section, are to be read as if the words, 'including the property following, 954 'that is to say ' (and then all the sub sections) had been there inserted.\\\" In Nevill vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (supra) Lord Haldane said: \\\" 'Passes ' may be taken as meaning 'changes hands '.\\nThe principle is contained in section 1.\\nSection 2 combines definitions of such property with the extension of the application of the principle laid down in section 1 to certain cases which are not in reality cases of changing hands on death at all.\\\".\\nIn Public Trustee vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (Re.\\nArnholz) the House of Lords after a lapse of over 60 years, however, struck a discordant note.\\nThe theory of 'mutual exclusiveness ' of sections 1 and 2 enunciated by Lord Macnaghten was not accepted.\\nIt was held s.1 imposed the charge in general terms and s.2, by exclusion and inclusion, defined area of that charge.\\nNo clear exposition was given or required to be given on the facts of the case of what was the precise effect of the two sections or their relationship to one another.\\nThere followed a period of uncertainty as to the precise relationship between the two sections, although subsequent to Arnholz 's case section 1 alone was held to be still capable of imposing a charge of duty, and where both sections 1 and 2 applied, the property was held to be dutiable under both concurrently.\\nIf the property which passed was identical with the property which would otherwise be deemed to pass, the question under which head it shall be taxed was purely academic.\\nEstate duty is not leviable more than once on the same death in respect of any property, even if it is chargeable under more than one head.\\nIn Weir 's Settlement Trusts, Re.\\nMc Pherson vs Inland Revenue Commissioners, the contention on behalf of the tax payer was that the decision in Public Trustee vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (Re.\\nArnholz) established the complete reverse of the view expressed by Lord Macnaghten in Earl Cowley 's case, that is, established that section 2 exhaustively laid down the only circumstances in which estate duty was leviable, and that if the circumstance could not be brought within section 1, as being circumstances set out in section 2, that was the end of the matter, the phrase in section 1 'property which passes on the death ' having no content independent of section 2.\\n955 Russell L.J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, resolved the doubts as to the relationship of ss.1 and 2 of the Act, and rejected the contention of the tax payer, observing: \\\"It was certainly not decided by the majority in Arnholz 's case that, as a matter of construction, the entire content of 'property. which passes on death ' in section 1 was to be found in s.2.\\n\\\" As regards the relationship of sections 1 and 2, he stated: \\\"Our view of the relationship of the two sections is as follows.\\nIt is section 1 that imposes the charge of estate duty on the value of property described as 'property. which passes on the death '.\\nSection 2(1) does not describe a different category of property, being property deemed to pass on a death.\\nSection 2(1) states certain situations in relation to property which involve that property in section 1 as property which passes on a death.\\nWe see no reason to hold that section 2(1) was intended exhaustively to define and limit the situations in relation to property which thus involve that property.\\nThe language is not apt for that purpose; and the fact that the situations envisaged embrace occasions when without guidance from section 2 (1) the property would be manifestly 'property. which passes on the death ' does not mean that they embrace all such occasions.\\n\\\" The question is a difficult one on which there may well be divergence of opinion, as reflected in these English decisions which largely turn on the construction of sections 1 and 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, the provisions of which are somewhat similar to those of sections 5 and 6 of the Act.\\nThe simultaneous existence of a right to tax under sections 1 and 2 was inconsistent with the well known statement of Lord Macnaghten in Earl Cowley 's case and could not, therefore, be sustained.\\nNevertheless, the trend of judicial opinion in England rightly changed, as we think that Lord Macnaghten 's opinion ought not to be regarded as subject to such refinement.\\nThe Andhra Pradesh High Court in Smt.\\nShantabai Jadhav 's case (supra) held that notwithstanding the fact that the property was purchased in the name of the wife, and had been included by 956 the deceased as his own property in the wealth tax returns filed by him, it could not be held to be the property of the deceased, for the purpose of its inclusion in the estate of the deceased.\\nIt was observed: \\\"Even assuming that the money for the purchase was found by her husband, it does not mean that he had beneficial interest in the property.\\nNormally, a husband takes a sale in the name of his wife either to make a provision for her or to screen the property from creditors, i.e., to keep it beyond the reach of the creditors.\\nWhatever may be the motive, so long as the deed stands in the name of another person, it could not be said that it was competent for the deceased to dispose of the property.\\nSection 6 of the enacts that property which the deceased was at the time of his death competent to dispose of shall be deemed to pass on his death.\\nIt is thus manifest from the section that Estate duty could be levied in respect of the properties which could be disposed of by the deceased at the time of his death.\\n\\\" Repelling the contention that the wife could not have alienated the properties by herself and that any disposition by her would not pass the title to such purchaser, having regard to the fact that it was open to the husband to impeach the sale sometime later, on the ground that the beneficial interest always vested in him, consideration having been paid by him, the Court relied upon the provisions of section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act and further observed: \\\"Be that as it may, so long as the documents stand in the name of his wife, he could not dispose of the property.\\nIt is true that it was open to him to have obtained the declaration that he was the beneficial owner thereof notwithstanding the fact that his wife was the ostensible owner.\\nBut, so long as the husband does not have any recourse to these proceedings for obtaining such a relief, he could not have been in a position to dispose of the property standing in the name of the third person as his own.\\nThis proposition was not contested on behalf of the Central Board of Revenue.\\n\\\" In Smt.\\nDenaabi Boman Shah 's case (supra) following its earlier decision in Smt.\\nShantabai Jadhav 's case while dealing with a similar benami transaction, the High Court held that the value of property held by a benamidar could not be included in the value of the property left by the deceased. 957 In Controller of Estate Duty vs M. L. Manchanda, the Punjab and Haryana High Court following these decisions had held that property which stood in the name of wife and of which the husband was the real owner, was upon the wife 's death chargeable to estate duty under section 5(1) of the Act, observing: \\\"Irrespective of the fact that the husband was the true owner of the property, there was nothing to prevent the wife a minute before her death to transfer the property.\\nThe legal title against the entire world excepting the true owner, vested in her and she had thus the right to dispose of that right, and once that right is conceded, the property shall be deemed to pass on her death and would, therefore, be liable to the levy of estate duty under section 5 of the Act.\\n\\\" In delivering the judgment of the Full Bench in O. section Chawla vs Controller of Estate Duty, Dwivedi J. observes: \\\"The scheme of the Act is two fold.\\nFirstly, there are properties which pass on the death of a person.\\nSection 5(1) imposes duty on their value.\\nSecondly, there are properties in which the deceased had an interest or power of appointment and which really do not pass on his death.\\nThe scheme of the Act is to impose duty on the value of such properties also.\\nIn the second class will fall provisions like sections 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.\\nThe Act creates a fiction of law to declare that the properties mentioned in those sections will be deemed to pass on the death of a person, though they do not 'pass ' in fact.\\n\\\" This two fold scheme is made plain by the definition in section 2(16) and section 3(3).\\nSection 2(16) defines the phrase 'property passing on death '.\\nSection 3(3) declares that references in the Act to 'property passing on the death ' of a person shall be construed as including references to 'property deemed to pass on the death ' of such person.\\nThe statement of objects and reasons of the Bill which ripened into the Act also emphasises the two fold scheme.\\nIt states that the 'object of the Bill is to impose an estate duty on property passing or deemed to pass on the death of a person '.\\nThe object of section 6 is to catch properties in the set of section 5(1) which do not really pass on the death of a person.\\nFor instance, property comprised in a revocable gift is property which the donor is competent to dispose of whether the gift is 958 revoked or not and will be covered by section 6.\\nSimilarly, property in respect of which the deceased had the power of appointment will also fall within section 6.\\n\\\" We are in agreement with the observations made by the learned Judge on the relative scope of section 5 and section 6 of the Act, which bring out the true legislative intent.\\nIn applying the Act to any particular transaction, regard must be had to its substance, that is, its true legal effect, rather to the form in which it is carried out.\\nOn the facts found, it has been established beyond doubt that the deceased was the real owner of the shares.\\nThe ownership which the deceased had in the shares passed on his death and must be brought to charge under sub section\\n(1) of section 5.\\nAll that has been said above is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\\nIt, however, becomes necessary to deal with the law relating to benami transactions as there is some misconception as to the nature of the rights of a benamidar.\\nWhat follows is purely elementary.\\nThe law in this matter is not in doubt and is authoritatively stated by a long line of decisions of the Privy Council starting from the well known case of Gopeekrist Gosain vs Gungapersaud Gosain to Sura Lakshmiah Chetty vs Kothandarama Pillai and of this Court in Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. vs C.I.T. As observed by Knight Bruce L.J. in Gopeekrist Gosain 's case, the doctrine of advancement is not applicable in India, so as to raise the question of a resulting trust.\\nWhen a property is purchased by a husband in the name of his wife, or by a father in the name of his son, it must be presumed that they are benamidars, and if they claim it as their own by alleging that the husband or the father intended to make a gift of the property to them, the onus rests upon them to establish such a gift.\\nIn Sura Lakshmiah Chetty 's case, the law was stated with clarity by Sir John Edge in these words: \\\"There can be no doubt now that a purchase in India by a native of India of property in India in the name of his wife unexplained by other proved or admitted facts is to be regarded as a benami transaction, by which the beneficial interest in the property is in the husband, although the ostensible title is in the wife.\\n\\\" 959 It is but axiomatic that a benami transaction does not vest any title in the benamidar but vests it in the real owner.\\nWhen the benamidar is in possession of the property standing in his name, he is in a sense the trustee for the real owner; he is only a name lender or an alias for the real owner.\\nIn Petheperumal Chetty vs Muniandy Servai, the Judicial Committee quoted with approval the following passage from Mayne 's Hindu Law 7th ed., para 446: \\\"Where a transaction is once made out to be a mere benami, it is evident that the benamidar absolutely disappears from the title.\\nHis name is simply an alias for that of the person beneficially interested.\\n\\\" The cardinal distinction between a trustee known to English law and a benamidar lies in the fact that a trustee is the legal owner of the property standing in his name and cestui que trust is only a beneficial owner, whereas in the case of a benami transaction the real owner has got the legal title though the property is in the name of the benamidar.\\nIt is well settled that the real owner can deal with the property without reference to the latter.\\nIn Gur Narayan vs Sheo Lal Singh, the Judicial Committee referred to the judgment of Sir George Farwell in Mst.\\nBilas Kunwar vs Dasraj Ranjit Singh, where it was observed that a benami transaction had a curious resemblance to the doctrine of English law that the trust of the legal estate results to the man who pays the purchase money, and went on to say: \\\". the benamidar has no beneficial interest in the property or business that stands in his name; he represents, in fact, the real owner, and so far as their relative legal position is concerned he is a mere trustee for him.\\n\\\" In Guran Ditta vs Ram Ditta the Judicial Committee reiterated the principle laid down in Gopeekrist Gosain 's case and observed that in case of a benami transaction, there is a resulting trust in favour of the person providing the purchase money.\\nA benamidar has no interest at all in the property standing in his name.\\nWhere the transaction is once made out to be benami, the Court must give effect to the real and not to the nominal title subject to certain exceptions.\\nIn Mulla 's Hindu Law, 14th edn.\\n, p. 638, four exceptions to the normal rule are brought out.\\nBut these exceptions are not material in this case.\\nOne of the exceptions 960 enumerated therein is that where a benamidar sells, mortgages or otherwise transfers for value property held by him without the knowledge of the real owner, the real owner is not entitled to have the transfer set aside unless the transferee had notice, actual or constructive that the transferor was merely a benamidar.\\nThe principle is embodied in section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act.\\nThe section makes an exception to the rule that a person cannot confer a better title than he has.\\nThe section is based on the well known passage from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Ramcoomar Koondoo vs Macqueen: \\\"It is a principle of natural equity, which must be universally applicable, that where one man allows another to hold himself out as the owner of an estate, and a third person purchases it for value from the apparent owner in the belief that he is the real owner, the man who so allows the other to hold himself out shall not be permitted to recover upon his secret title unless he can other throw that of the purchaser by showing, either that he had direct notice, or something which amounts to constructive notice, of the real title, or that there existed circumstances which ought to have put him upon an inquiry that, if prosecuted, would have led to a discovery of it.\\\" A benamidar is an ostensible owner and if a person purchases from a benamidar, the real owner cannot recover unless he shows that the purchaser had actual or constructive notice of the real title.\\nBut from this it does not follow that the benamidar has real title to the property, he is merely an ostensible owner thereof.\\nThe law is succinctly stated by Mayne in his Treatise on Hindu Law, 11th edn., at p. 953, in the following terms: \\\"A benami transaction is one where one buys property in the name of another or gratuitously transfers his property to another, without indicating an intention to benefit the other.\\nThe benamidar, therefore, has no beneficial interest in the property or business that stands in his name; he represents in fact the real owner and so far as their relative legal position is concerned, he is a mere trustee for him.\\nIn other words, a benami purchase or conveyance leads to a resulting trust in India, just as a purchase or transfer under similar circumstances leads to a resulting trust in England.\\nThe general rule and principle of the Indian law as to resulting trusts differs but little if at all, from the general rule of English law upon the same subject.\\n\\\" 961 (See also : Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. vs C.I.T. per Venkatarama Ayyar J., and Thakur Bhim Singh vs Thakur Kan Singh ; Per Venkataramiah J.] In the light of these settled principles the liability to pay estate duty under section 5 (1) of the Act arises upon the death of the real owner and not of the benamidar, who is merely an ostensible owner.\\nThe test lies in whether upon the death of the benamidar, there would be incidence of liability to estate duty.\\nIf the view of the High Court were to be accepted, the estate left by the deceased would escape the duty altogether.\\nWe do not see how section 6 of the Act comes into play at all in this case.\\nIn view of the finding that the shares were purchased by the deceased benami in the name of his wife and sons etc.\\n, the real ownership of the property was vested in the deceased was entitled to deal with the same as if it were his own and the benamidars held it in trust under section 82 of the Trusts Act, 1882 for the benefit of the deceased.\\nThe benamidars, subject to the equities flowing from section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, could not deal with the shares in any way.\\nAccordingly, the estate belonged to the deceased who died possessed of the same, and under section 5(1) of the Act the entire value of the shares was includible in the principle value of the estate of the deceased on his death.\\nFor these reasons, the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the question is answered in the affirmative and in favour of the Controller of Estate Duty.\\nThere shall be no order as to costs.\\nN.V.K.

No. 13/1939.\\nThis execution proceeding had to be stayed .as a result of the stay order of the High Court.\\nUltimately the executing court made an order on E.P. 13/1939 to the effect that the Execution Petition was \\\"closed\\\".\\nOn January 21, 1952, the decree holders made an application for reopening the execution E.P. No. 13/1939 and for proceeding with the execution of the decree, The Subordinate Judge, (executing court) holding that the previous execution petition was merely closed\\\" directed the decree holders to file a regular execution petition.\\nOn October 11, 1952 the decree holders filed E.P. No. 58/53 to continue further proceedings in E.P. No. 13/1939.\\nThe judgment debtors filed a counter affidavit pleading, inter alia that the decree sought to be executed was made on September 22, 1938, and that as E.P. No. 13/1939 was dismissed on December 28, 1948, the present application, having been filed more than 12 years from the date of decree, was barred under section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\\nOn these facts the Subordinate Judge held that though the decree holders were entitled to continue previous execution petition, E.P. No. 58/53 was a fresh application as it differed from the original execution petition.\\nOn appeal, the High Court held that E.P. No. 13/1939 was merely closed for statistical purposes, and, therefore, the execution petition filed in 1939 was still pending and the decree holders were entitled to proceed with that petition.\\nHence the appeal.\\nThe question for consideration is whether E.P. No. 58/53 is a fresh application within the meaning of section 48 of the Code.\\nHeld: (i) It is true courts have condemned the practice of executing courts using expressions like \\\"closed\\\", \\\"closed for statistical purposes\\\", struck off\\\" \\\"recorded\\\" etc., and they have also pointed out that there is no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure for making such orders.\\nBut assuming that the court has no such power, the passing of such ,in order cannot be tantamount to an order of dismissal, for the intention of the court in making an order \\\"closed\\\" for statistical purposes is manifest.\\nIt is intended not to finally dispose of the application, but to keep it pending.\\nWhether the order was without jurisdiction or whether it was valid, the legal position would be the same: in one case it would be ignored and in the other it would mean what it stated.\\nIn either case the execution petition would be pending on the file of the court.\\nIt is not the phraseology used by the Executing Court that really 252 matters, but is is really the substance of the order that is material.\\nWhatever terminology may be used, it is for the Court to ascertain, having regard to the circumstances under which the said order was made, whether the Court intended to finally terminate the execution proceedings.\\nIf it did not intend to do so, it must be held that the execution proceedings were pending on the file of the Court.\\nIn the present case the subsequent application ie.\\nE.P. No. 58/53 is only an application to continue the previous application i.e. E.P. 13/1939.\\nBiswa Sonan Chunder Gossyamy vs Binanda Chander Dibingar Adhikar Gossyamy, Cal.\\n416, Vadlamannati Damodara Rao vs Official Receiver, Kistna, I.L.R. 1946 Mad. 527 and Moidin Kutty vs Doraiswami, A.I.R. 1952 Mad. 51, referred to.\\n(ii) An application made after 12 years from the date of decree would be a fresh application within the meaning of section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if the previous application was finally disposed of.\\nIt would also be a fresh application if it asked for a relief against parties or properties different from those proceeded against in the previous execution petition or asked for a relief substantially different from that asked for in the earlier petition.\\nIn the present case the parties are substantially the same in both proceedings, and the decree holders are only proceeding against properties included in the previous application ie.\\nE.P.
